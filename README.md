# hello-world
first github tutorial. 

My name is Jess and I'm a software engineer who works primarily with legacy databases on a massive ETL project at a large company.  I'm hoping by being apart of this community I am able to learn more about programming and contribute/contribute to some cool projects that are helping the world. I'm so excited to be here!
